The data to use for this project shows coral bleaching data for 8 sites in the Great Barrier Reef. It gives the % of bleaching for different kinds of coral: hard corals, sea pens, blue corals, soft corals and sea fans over the last 8 years (though not all sites have data for the entire period, and not all corals are found at each site). The data is fictional.

Our job is to look at the data and determine:
1) In which years and for which kinds of coral bleaching is the worst
2) How the location of the site affects bleaching on the different kinds of coral
